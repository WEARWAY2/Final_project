# Hero Image Setup

To complete the hero section, you need to add a hero image to your project.

## Option 1: Using your own image

1. Place your hero image (the couple wearing fashionable clothes) in the `public` folder
2. Name it `hero-image.jpg` (or update the path in `Home.jsx` if you use a different name)

## Option 2: Temporary placeholder

The current setup shows a gradient background. You can:

- Add your actual image file to `/public/hero-image.jpg`
- Or update the image path in `src/pages/Home.jsx` line 51

The hero section is fully functional and will display your image once it's added to the public folder.
