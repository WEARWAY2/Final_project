# My E-commerce (starter)

This project previously used the Vite + React demo template. The demo example code was removed and replaced with a minimal e-commerce starter scaffold so you can begin building your app.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run dev server:

   npm run dev

3. Build for production:

   npm run build

Notes

- The example Vite/React demo (logos, counter, and demo styles) was removed from `src/`.
- You'll find a small starter UI in `src/App.jsx` and simple styles in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
- Replace components with your own pages, product list, and cart as needed.

If you'd like, I can scaffold a couple of pages (products, product detail, cart) and wire up React Router and a minimal cart context next.
